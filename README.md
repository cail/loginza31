# Loginza31

Thats a minimal port of loginza phpbb 3.0 mod into the new phpBB 3.1 (and probably 3.2) Ext infrastructure.

Should be compatible with all themes.

It does not use auth providers infrastructure of phpbb, but instead directly creates user accounts.

Installation is regular: clone into

    phpBB3/ext/cail/loginza31

folder. It'll appear in phpbb admin panel then.
